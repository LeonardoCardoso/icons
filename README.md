## Sketch template for generating all iOS 10 App icon sizes

### Open the Sketch file to view step-by-step instructions.

####How it Works
This template was created from [Apple's resources and guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/resources/) (with attention paid to detail and accuracy).

Design your icon inside the 120x120 symbol. The [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) template uses that symbol to display (in real time) every app icon size you need for you iPhone or iPad app.

Preview any of them on your device using Sketch Mirror. Cmd + Shift + E to export them all.

Enjoy!
